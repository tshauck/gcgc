# Command Line Interface

GCGC is primarily intended to be used as a library as part of a larger project, however it does ship
with a CLI to support some use cases. Moreover, as the package matures expect more functionality
especially as it relates to PyTorch and TensorFlow dataset creation so GCGC can be used as part of a
larger data processing workflows.

## Getting Help

To get help with the GCGC CLI, run:

```sh
$ gcgc --help
```

For example, one of the commands listed is `version` -- which is run like:

```sh
$ gcgc version
0.2.2
```

Which prints `0.2.2`, which was the installed version at the time of writing.
