# Welcome to the GCGC Docs

GCGC is a package written in Python to facilitate feature pre-processing for biological sequences.
Think of it like a Natural Language Processing pre-processing toolkit with design choices oriented
towards the differences the sequences found in NLP vs biology.

There are two main points of entry to GCGC. First, it can be imported as a Python package, and,
second, used as a command line tool for specific types of transformations. In this case, the ideas
is for the tools to be integrated into a larger processing pipeline.

## Python Package

In general, operations that would modify the sequence return a new `EncodedSeq` object, which is a subclass of `Bio.Seq.Seq`.

```python
from gcgc.encoded_seq import EncodedSeq
from gcgc.alphabet import IUPACUnambiguousDNAEncoding

>>> es = EncodedSeq("ATCG", IUPACUnambiguousDNAEncoding())
EncodedSeq('ATCG', IUPACUnambiguousDNAEncoding())

>>> es.pad(pad_to=10)
EncodedSeq('ATCG||||||', IUPACUnambiguousDNAEncoding())

>>> es.encapsulate()
EncodedSeq('>ATCG<', IUPACUnambiguousDNAEncoding())
```

The `EncodedSeq` object also support chaining.

```python
>>> es.encapsulate().conform(7)
EncodedSeq('>ATCG<|', IUPACUnambiguousDNAEncoding())
```

Otherwise there exists properties on the `EncodedSeq` object to get it in a form amenable to traditional ML modeling pipelines.

For example, turning it into a one hot encoded matrix or integer encoded.

```python
>>> es.one_hot_encoded
[[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

>>> es.integer_encoded
[1, 2, 3, 0]
```

To do this, the alphabet holds a mapping from the letters on the associated `Bio.Alphabet.Alphabet` object.

```python
>>> es.alphabet.encoding_index
{'G': 0, 'A': 1, 'T': 2, 'C': 3, '>': 4, '<': 5, '|': 6}
```

The last three characters are the start (`es.alphabet.START`), the end (`es.alphabet.END`), and the padding (`es.alphabet.PADDING`), respectively.

The alphabet concept is once of the key differences relative to NLP vocabulary, the in the bio case the vocabulary is relatively small and known a priori.

## Third Party Tools

GCGC aims to support popular machine learning libraries by providing utilities to bridge the gap
between the library's native tooling for data ingestion and the sequencing data.
