!!! Caution
  GCGC is in active development.

# Homepage

GCGC is a package written in Python for pre-processing for biological sequences. Think of it like a
Natural Language Processing pre-processing toolkit with design choices oriented towards the
differences the sequences found in natural language vs biology.

GCGC has two main points of entry. First, imported as a Python package, and,
second, used as a command line tool for specific types of transformations. In this case, the ideas
is to integrate GCGC into a larger data processing pipeline.

## Installation

Install GCGC via pip:

```bash
$ pip install gcgc
```

If you'd like to use one of the third party tools, install the related "extras".

```bash
$ pip install gcgc[torch]
```
