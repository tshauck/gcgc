!!! Development Warning
    GCGC is in active development.

# Homepage

GCGC is a package written in Python for pre-processing for biological sequences. Think of it like a
Natural Language Processing pre-processing toolkit with design choices oriented towards the
differences the sequences found in natural language vs biology.

GCGC has two main points of entry. First, imported as a Python package, and,
second, used as a command line tool for specific types of transformations. In this case, the ideas
is to integrate GCGC into a larger data processing pipeline.

## Installation

Install GCGC via pip:

```bash
$ pip install gcgc
```

## Getting Started

For a full example of using GCGC with a classification model, see the [splice site
example](./third_party_integrations/pytorch_utils.md).
