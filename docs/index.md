GCGC is a package written in Python to facilitate feature pre-processing for biological sequences.
Think of it like a Natural Language Processing pre-processing toolkit with design choices oriented
towards the differences the sequences found in natural language vs biology.

There are two main points of entry to GCGC. First, it can be imported as a Python package, and,
second, used as a command line tool for specific types of transformations. In this case, the ideas
is for the tools to be integrated into a larger processing pipeline.

## Installation

GCGC can be installed via pip:

```bash
$ pip install gcgc
```

## Getting Started

For a full example of using GCGC with a classification model, see the [splice site
example](./third_party_integrations/pytorch_utils.md).
